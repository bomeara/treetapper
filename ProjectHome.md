http://www.treetapper.org is a site for organizing  what is known and left to discover in the field of phylogenetics, focusing on identifying where methods and/or  software are not available to answer questions. This code is for generating the web site (so, like a typical content management system) and also generates information on presence/absence of various methods and software. It may be adaptable to different fields besides phylogenetics. This represents part of the postdoctoral and later work of <a href='http://www.brianomeara.info'>Brian O'Meara</a> and has been funded by the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (<a href='http://www.nescent.org'>NESCent</a>) (NSF #EF-0423641).
